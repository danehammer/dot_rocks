This website partially exists to talk about myself, yes. I'm a good Software Engineer. Lots of time spent building Java libraries, and scripting with Ruby, and building small web apps like this one. But there are lots of people who do those things. I bring that, as well as the Lean, Systems Thinking required to move from our traditional Enterprise roles in this industry, to a DevOps mindset, where being able to write good code isn't enough to deliver a good client experience. I have both coding experience, and deployment experience.

This website is a web app, but it's deployed on [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean), with every step automated to take it from a blank, fresh VM to a functioning website. It was first written with Sinatra, but has been ported to Jekyll. I had only passing skill in most web technologies when I set out to build this, but I love learning new things, and I'm committed to learning what I need to fulfill my goal.
